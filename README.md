Download all 3. Put them in a folder on their own. 

From the commmand line, in that folder use
  python PartyMacroWriter.py 'Player1,Player2,Player3'
This creates a new text file called GroupMacros.txt
The format of which is
  Passive Perception Macro:   (WHISPERED) so the DM can check it themself. Append to the party dnd token Abilities (explained below)
  Active Perception Macro:    (so all can roll with one click from the dm, without opening C-sheets, if the players are okay with it being rolled for them)
  
(Active and Passive Perception Rolls for the whole party will output in a table in roll20 chat.)
  Then, Each Player gets a section:
_______________________Macros for PLAYER1:
  How they can implement OneDnD Exhaustion. 
  How to add general token macros, for attacks and the likes. (NOT THE HOTBAR ONES) -
(THESE ARE INCREDIBLY USEFUL FOR NPC SHEETS so DM doesnt have to open up lots of C-sheets. the options only appear when the token is selected. )
  Then What Macro:
  The macro code OR how to implement it (For OneDnD Exhaustion and Quality scores) 


It is important to note. 
Player names must match that of the C-sheet exactly. 
They are fed to the cript in speec marks, seperated by commas. 
If the PC sheet has a comma, it won't work. 
After each comma, do not add a space before typing the next name that will result in th wrong names in the macros and therefore they wont work.
